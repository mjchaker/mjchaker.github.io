# Early Life

I was born in Dubai on July 22, 2002, making me 22 years old as time of writing. I lived in Bahrain and attentded two private schools. I used to visit my grandparents each summer in Lebanon. My first experience with video games was probably when my dad got me a PlayStation 2. I remember listening to music in the car with my dad and watching music videos on a forty two inch flatscreen. I did choir for a while (I still rememeber the lyrics to Sweeny Todd). My only experience with sports was in physical education class. 

# About me

I am ethnically Lebaneese. I stand one hundred and seventy two meters tall, weigh about sixty two kilograms, and have brown eyes and black hair. I have two brothers and a sister. I attended Barrie North Collegiate Institute, live in Barrie and will be moving to Oshawa to start engineering at Ontario Tech. I recently bought a custom built desktop off a friend. It has a NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti, a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700K, and 48GB of RAM. My favourite games are Call of Duty, Marvel Rivals and League of Legends. I have two cats named Milo and Lea.

# Music

I have been playing the piano since I was seven years old, and have been playing the guitar since I was twenty years old. I have taken a couple of lessons; However, they have never really stuck. My genres are rock, pop, and hip-hop music. I have a basic knowledge of musical theory; I understand how to construct the seven different modes. I know music theory and have a strong working knowledge of Logic Pro. I know many chord shapes and can play bar chords fairly well.
