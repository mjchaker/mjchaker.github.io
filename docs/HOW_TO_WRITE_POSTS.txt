HOW TO WRITE BLOG POSTS FOR YOUR JEKYLL WEBSITE
================================================

This guide explains how to create new physics articles and blog posts for your Jekyll website.

FILE NAMING CONVENTION
----------------------
All blog posts must be saved in the _posts/ directory with this exact naming format:

    YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md

Examples:
    2025-06-19-quantum-mechanics-introduction.md
    2025-07-15-thermodynamics-explained.md
    2025-08-03-special-relativity-basics.md

REQUIRED FRONT MATTER
---------------------
Every post must start with YAML front matter between triple dashes (---).
Here's the template:

---
layout: post
title: "Your Article Title Here"
date: 2025-06-19 12:00:00 -0500
categories: physics quantum-mechanics thermodynamics
tags: [physics, science, education, research]
author: "Mohamad Jad Chaker"
excerpt: "A brief 1-2 sentence description that appears in the blog listing."
---

FRONT MATTER FIELDS EXPLAINED
------------------------------
- layout: Always use "post" for blog articles
- title: The main title of your article (use quotes)
- date: Publication date and time (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TIMEZONE)
- categories: Space-separated categories (no quotes, lowercase with hyphens)
- tags: Array format with brackets and quotes [tag1, tag2, tag3]
- author: Your name (use quotes)
- excerpt: Brief description shown on blog listing page (use quotes)

WRITING YOUR CONTENT
--------------------
After the closing --- of the front matter, write your article content using Markdown:

# Main Heading
## Sub Heading
### Smaller Heading

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

1. Numbered list item 1
2. Numbered list item 2

[Link text](https://example.com)

For mathematical equations, you can use LaTeX notation:
$$E = mc^2$$

Or inline math: $F = ma$

CODE BLOCKS
-----------
For code examples:

```python
def example_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

Or inline code: `variable_name`

PHYSICS-SPECIFIC FORMATTING
---------------------------
For physics content, consider using:

- Greek letters: α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ, ν, ξ, ο, π, ρ, σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω
- Mathematical symbols: ∞, ∑, ∏, ∫, ∂, ∇, ±, ≈, ≠, ≤, ≥
- Units: Use proper notation like m/s², kg⋅m/s², etc.

CATEGORIES AND TAGS SUGGESTIONS
-------------------------------
Common categories for physics posts:
- physics
- quantum-mechanics
- thermodynamics
- electromagnetism
- classical-mechanics
- relativity
- particle-physics
- astrophysics
- optics
- materials-science

Common tags:
- [physics, science, education]
- [quantum, mechanics, theory]
- [thermodynamics, heat, energy]
- [relativity, einstein, spacetime]
- [experiments, laboratory, research]

PUBLISHING WORKFLOW
-------------------
1. Create your .md file in _posts/ with proper naming
2. Add the required front matter
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Save the file
5. Commit and push to GitHub (the site builds automatically)
6. Your post will appear at: yoursite.com/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/title/

TIPS FOR BETTER POSTS
---------------------
- Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate the topic
- Write engaging excerpts that make people want to read more
- Break up long text with headings, bullet points, and images
- Include relevant tags to help readers find related content
- Preview your post locally before publishing if possible
- Use consistent formatting and style across all posts

EXAMPLE POST STRUCTURE
----------------------
