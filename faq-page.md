## Education

### What are you studying?
I'm planning to study engineering at Ontario Tech University. My educational background includes coursework in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and English from the University of Waterloo.

### Why did you choose engineering?
Engineering combines my passion for technology with problem-solving. It allows me to apply mathematical and scientific principles to create practical solutions that can make a real impact.

### What math courses have you taken?
At the University of Waterloo, I've completed several mathematics courses that have prepared me for engineering studies. These courses have given me a strong foundation in calculus, linear algebra, and other mathematical concepts essential for engineering.

## Technical Background

### What programming languages do you know?
Please check out my [Technical Skills](/skills/) page for a comprehensive list of programming languages and technologies I work with.

### What kind of projects have you worked on?
I've worked on various software development projects. You can find detailed information about my work on my [Projects](/projects/) page.

### What development environment do you use?
I work on a 13.3 inch M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM running macOS 15. This setup provides excellent performance for development work and is particularly efficient for compiling and running code.

## Personal Interests

### What are your hobbies outside of programming?
I'm passionate about music and gaming. These interests complement my technical pursuits by providing creative outlets and helping me understand user experience from different perspectives.

### How do music and gaming relate to your engineering interests?
Both music and gaming involve complex systems and patterns. Music theory shares mathematical principles with programming, while gaming requires understanding of physics engines, graphics rendering, and user interaction designâ€”all relevant to engineering and software development.
