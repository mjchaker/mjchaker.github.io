# About
I was born in Dubai and lived in Bahrain. I am ethnically Lebanese and lived in Bahrain. I currently reside in Barrie and will be moving to Oshawa.

# Education
Before I moved to Canada, I attended the International School of Choueifat and the British School of Bahrain. After I moved to Canada, I attended Portage View Public School and Barrie North Collegiate Institute. In my senior year of high school, I took chemistry, physics, computer science, advanced functions, and calculus & vectors. After graduating, I went to Waterloo to pursue an undergraduate science degree in mathematical physics and now have a solid theoretical foundation in science. I am planning to start engineering at [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca).

# Hobbies
I am a musician. I play the piano and the guitar. I have taken some lessons. My favourite genres are rock, pop, and hip-hop music. I have a basic knowledge of musical theory; for example, I understand how to construct the seven different modes from the major scale. I have a strong working knowledge of the digital audio workstation [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/logic-pro/). 

I am a gamer. Recently, I bought a custom built desktop computer off a friend. It has a NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti, a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700K, and 48GB of RAM. My favourite games are Call of Duty, Marvel Rivals and League of Legends! 

I was a martial artist ([Judo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo)) My highest ranking was orange belt. I know a little Japanese.
