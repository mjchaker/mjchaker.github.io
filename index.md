I was born in Dubai on July 22, 2002, making me 22 years old as time of writing. I lived in Bahrain and attended two private schools. I used to visit my grandparents each summer in Lebanon. My first experience with video games was probably when my dad got me a PlayStation 2. I remember listening to music in the car with my dad and watching music videos on a forty two inch flat screen. I did choir for a while (I still remember the lyrics to Sweeney Todd). My only experience with sports was in physical education class. 

I am ethnically Lebanese. I stand one hundred and seventy two meters tall, weigh about sixty two kilograms, and have brown eyes and black hair. I have two brothers and a sister. I attended Barrie North Collegiate Institute, live in Barrie and will be moving to Oshawa to start engineering at Ontario Tech. I recently bought a custom built desktop off a friend. It has a NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti, a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700K, and 48GB of RAM. My favourite games are Call of Duty, Marvel Rivals and League of Legends. I have two cats named Milo and Lea.
# Education

At the University of Waterloo, I have taken the following classes (A first year of Mathematical Physics)

- MATH 136 (Linear Algebra 1 for Honours Mathematics)
- MATH 137 (Calculus 1 for Honours Mathematics)
- MATH 138 (Calculus 2 for Honours Mathematics)
- PHYS 121 + PHYS 121L (Mechanics + Mechanics Lab)
- PHYS 122 + PHYS 132L (Waves Electricity & Magnetism + Waves Electricity & Magnetism Lab)
- PHYS 124 (Modern Physics)
- CHEM 120 + CHEM 120L (General Chemistry 1 + General Chemistry 1 Lab)
- CHEM 123L (General Chemistry 2 Lab)
- SPCOM 193 (Communication in the Sciences)

 After the general first year at Ontario Tech, I will probably declare my major as electrical engineering.

# Hobbies

I have been playing the piano since I was seven years old, and have been playing the guitar since I was twenty years old. I have taken a couple of lessons; However, they have never really stuck. My genres are rock, pop, and hip-hop music. I have a basic knowledge of musical theory; I understand how to construct the seven different modes. I know music theory and have a strong working knowledge of Logic Pro. I know many chord shapes and can play bar chords fairly well.

I used to do Judo. I got up to orange belt. I still remember how to count to ten in Japanese and many of the names of techniques!

# Technical Skills

I know C, Java, Python and Scheme. Imperative and functional programming.  I know how to install and configure various computer operating systems; these include including Debian, Fedora, and Gentoo.

# Projects

In high school (Ontario), I took ICS. Both grade 11 and grade 12 high school classes had a final project as part of the final grade. In grade 11, I made a racing game in Turing. If you can find an interpreter, it will run flawlessly.

In grade 12, I made a program that, when given the coefficients of a quadratic function, it computes the roots of said function. It works by implementing the quadratic formula. When I made it, I had no idea about Newton's method or the half-interval method. (It is possible that the standard Java library implements square roots using one of these methods)

I helped configure the Linux kernel on LineageOS on the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge so that calls could work using the unique IC hardware at the time. I learned a lot about the kernel.

# Future Plans

I would like to start a technical blog explaining foundational concepts in physics and chemistry.
