# Hobbies

I am a musician. I play the piano and the guitar. I have taken some lessons. My favourite genres are rock, pop, and hip-hop music. I have a basic knowledge of musical theory; for example, I understand how to construct the seven different modes from the major scale. I have a strong working knowledge of the digital audio workstation Logic Pro. 

I recently bought a custom built desktop computer off a friend. It has a NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti, a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700K, and 48GB of RAM. I use it to mainly game. My favourite games are Call of Duty, Marvel Rivals and League of Legends. 

I used to do practice [Judo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo). My highest ranking was orange belt. I still remember how to count to ten in Japanese and many of the names of techniques!

# Future Plans

I would like to start a technical blog explaining foundational concepts in physics and chemistry. I am planning to start engineering at Ontario Tech; after the general first year at Ontario Tech, I will probably declare my major as electrical engineering. Some day, I would like to go to the San Francisco, California.
