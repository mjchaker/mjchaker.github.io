I was born in Dubai and I am ethnically Lebanese. I lived in Bahrain. I currently reside in Barrie and will be moving to Oshawa, Ontario. I speak English, Arabic and some French.
# Education
Before I moved to Canada, I attended the International School of Choueifat and the British School of Bahrain. After I moved to Canada, I attended Portage View Public School and Barrie North Collegiate Institute. In my senior year of high school, I took chemistry, physics, computer science, advanced functions, and calculus & vectors. After graduating, I went to Waterloo to pursue an undergraduate science degree in mathematical physics and now have a solid theoretical foundation in science. I am planning to start engineering at [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca).

I am a musician by nature. I play the piano and the guitar. My favourite musical genres are rock, pop, and hip-hop. I understand how to construct the seven different modes from the major scale. I have a strong working knowledge of the digital audio workstation [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/logic-pro/).
